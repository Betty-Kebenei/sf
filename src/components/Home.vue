      Senders Fellowship was established in September 2018
      by Angaza associates. Angaza ia a one year discipleship programme
      run by Missions Campaign network (MCN). The felt that there was a lack
      of structure that could help those called to serve in the marketplace
      remain accountable, have a fellowship and together do great things for
      God as we expect great things from God while in the marketplace.

      Members of the Senders Fellowship always meet once a month on a Sunday and
      also give monthly contibutions to support those who are called to go.
